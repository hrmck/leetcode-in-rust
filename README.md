# Learning Log

## Day 1 (2022/05/02)

- following LeetCode's Programming Skills I to familiarize myself with Rust
  - did questions 1492 and 1523
- first time to use Rust! I've learnt about:
  - basic data types (integers were mostly used in today's questions)
    - it is cool that there's `arch` to determine the integer size according to the machine's architecture
  - variables and constants: `let`, `mut`, `const`
  - if-else statements
  - `while` loop

  - revised about pointers
- LeetCode 191
  - Rust has a method `count_ones()` in `u32` which makes the solution a one-liner lol
- LeetCode 1281
  - should've used iterator

## Day 3 (2022/05/04)

- LeetCode 976
- LeetCode 1779
  - iterators
    - filter

    - peekable
  - :question: The performance and memory usage in this implemention is higher than the ones using for loops...why?
