# Learning Log

## Day 1 (2022/03/02)

- following LeetCode's Programming Skills I to familiarize myself with Rust
  - did questions 1492 and 1523
- first time to use Rust! I've learnt about:
  - basic data types (integers were mostly used in today's questions)
    - it is cool that there's `arch` to determine the integer size according to the machine's architecture
  - variables and constants: `let`, `mut`, `const`
  - if-else statements
  - `while` loop
